1. Learnt about Virtualization:
It is a technology that allows one computer to perform the job of multiple computers. Essentially, it enables a single personal personal computer to run multiple OS simultaneously and parrallely.

2. VMs:
VMs are Virtual machines, like a computer inside a computer, living in the physical machine. They are isolated from each other because each one has its own operating system. This isolation helps prevent catastrophe, mirroring the historical practice of running one main service per physical server to maintain separation.

3. Hypervisor:
It is the tool that enables virtualization and allows the creation of VMs. It is the medium that separates the host computer hardware from the virtual environments.

There are two main types: Bare metal that runs directly on the physical computer and is typically used for production environments, and the software installed on top of the host operating system. It is generally used for learning and testing purposes, such as the Oracl VM Virtualbox or the VMWare Fusion.

4. Tools used in Virtualization:
Vagrant: This is an automation tool for building and deploying virtualized enviroments, often exploting traditional VMs for resource isolation and cross-platform support.
Docker: An open-source platform that automates the development cycle of applications including software containers.

# WID
I used vagrant to spin up a VM using VMWare fusion as the hypervisor, in both Ubuntu and Centos. 
Ubuntu and CentOS are flavors of the Linux OS.

This is the config file I used:
config.vm.box = "bandit145/centos_stream9_arm" // Specifies to use centos as the vagrant box. This image is present on vagrant cloud.
config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.56.12" // Specifies a static IP address for the VM
config.vm.provider "vmware_desktop" do |vmware| // To use vmware as the hypervisor
    vmware.gui = true
    vmware.allowlist_verified = true   
 end
end
