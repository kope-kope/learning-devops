# What I Learned - December 29, 2025

## Introduction to Git

Today, I learned about **Git**, a powerful Version Control System (VCS) that helps track changes to repositories. Instead of manually creating backups when changes are made and rolling back when mistakes occur, Git handles the entire process automatically.

**Fun fact**: Git was created by Linus Torvalds - the same person who created the Linux kernel! He built both the kernel and the VCS to track changes made to code. Mind-blowing! 🤯

## Types of Version Control Systems

VCS can be categorized into three types:

### 1. **Local VCS**
- Version database is stored only on the local machine
- No collaboration features
- Simple but limited

### 2. **Centralized VCS** (e.g., SVN, Perforce)
- Single central server holds all versions of the code
- Developers check out files from the central server
- All commits go directly to the central server
- Requires network connection for most operations

### 3. **Distributed VCS** (e.g., Git, Mercurial)
- Every developer has a full repository copy with complete history
- Can work offline
- Commits are made locally, then pushed to remote
- Multiple remotes are possible
- **GitHub** (which I'm using to push this update) is a platform for distributed VCS

## Git Commands Learned

I learned numerous Git commands today, including:
- `git push` - Upload local commits to remote
- `git pull` - Download and merge remote changes
- `git commit` - Save changes to local repository
- `git tag` - Mark specific points in history
- `git release` - Create releases
- `git revert` - Undo commits safely
- And many more!

## Interesting Discoveries

### Nested Git Repositories
I was surprised to learn that you can push a parent folder that contains a sub-folder tracked with Git in a separate repository. This is useful for managing monorepos or including submodules.

### SSH vs HTTPS
I've been using HTTPS to connect my remote repository to my local machine, but today I tried SSH and it's much better! From now on, I'll be using SSH for authentication.

**Command to generate SSH key**:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

## Key Takeaways
- Git is a distributed VCS that provides powerful collaboration and versioning capabilities
- SSH authentication is more convenient than HTTPS for Git operations
- Understanding VCS types helps appreciate why Git has become the industry standard
