# What I Learned - December 22, 2025

## Overview

Today, I completed the Linux section of the course. The amount of content covered was extensive, and while it may take time to retain everything, I gained solid foundational knowledge across several key areas of Linux system administration.

## 🖊️ Vim Editor

Learned about the **Vim text editor** and its three primary modes:
- **Command mode** - Navigate and manipulate text
- **Insert mode** - Type and edit content
- **Extended command mode** - Execute commands (save, quit, search, etc.)

## 🔗 File System Concepts

### Symbolic Links
Discovered how to create **soft links** (symbolic links) in Linux file systems, which function similarly to shortcuts in Windows. This is a powerful way to create references to files and directories across the system.

## 🔍 Filters and I/O Redirection

### Key Filter Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `grep` | Search for lines containing specific patterns or characters |
| `less`/`more` | Display file content page by page or line by line |
| `head` | Display the first 10 lines of a file |
| `tail` | Display the last 10 lines of a file |
| `cut` | Extract sections from each line (acts as a delimiter) |
| `sed` | Stream editor for find and replace operations |

### I/O Redirection
**I/O redirection** allows you to copy the output of commands or files into new files, enabling powerful data manipulation and automation.

### Piping
**Piping** (`|`) feeds the output from one program as input to another program, allowing you to chain commands together for complex operations.

### The `find` Command
The `find` command searches for files or directories within a specified path based on given conditions or criteria.

## 👥 Users and Groups

### Core Concepts
- **Users and groups** control access to files and system resources
- Users authenticate by providing username and password
- Every file is owned by a user and associated with a group
- Every process has an owner and group affiliation, determining resource access
- Each user is assigned a unique **User ID (UID)**

### Storage Locations
- **Usernames and UIDs**: `/etc/passwd`
- **Encrypted passwords**: `/etc/shadow`
- **Group information**: `/etc/group`

### User Types

1. **Root User**
   - UID: 0
   - Home directory: `/root`
   - Default shell: `/bin/bash`
   - Full system privileges

2. **Regular Users**
   - UID range: 1000-60000
   - Maximum ~59,000 regular users can be created
   - Standard user accounts for system access

3. **Service Users**
   - System accounts for running services
   - Limited privileges for security

### User Management Operations
- Create new users
- Set and modify passwords
- Switch between user shells
- Add users to groups
- Manage user permissions

## 🔐 File Permissions

Learned comprehensive file permission management, including:
- Reading and interpreting permission notation
- Changing file ownership (user)
- Changing file group ownership
- Using `chmod`, `chown`, and `chgrp` commands
- Understanding permission levels (read, write, execute)

---

## 📦 Software Management

### Package Managers
Explored software installation and management using distribution-specific tools:
- **`yum`** - For CentOS/RHEL distributions
- **`apt`** - For Ubuntu/Debian distributions

This was particularly engaging as it involved practical interaction with repositories and network resources.

---

## ⚙️ System Administration

Covered essential system monitoring and management topics:
- **Services** - Managing system services and daemons
- **Processes** - Understanding and controlling running processes
- **System statistics** - Monitoring system performance and resource usage
- **Administrative commands** - Various utilities for system management

## 📝 Reflection

The Linux section provided a comprehensive introduction to system administration fundamentals. While the volume of information is substantial, consistent practice and hands-on application will solidify these concepts over time.
