1. Introduction to Linux:
Linux is the foundation of Devops. Linkus is absolutely essential for understanding.
Linux is an open source software, and by open source, it means that it is code that be inspected, modified and enhannced by others.
Linux is a Unix-line kernel?
The kernel is the core of an OS. It is the layer betwen hardware and software. it transaltes requests into the instructions the hardware undersands.

A unix-like kernel shares these characteristics:
1. Everything is a file — devices, processes, and network connections are represented as files
2. Small, focused programs — tools do one thing well and can be combined
3. Hierarchical file system — a single root (/) with directories branching from it
4. Shell-based interface — command-line shells for interaction
5. Multi-user, multi-tasking — supports multiple users and processes
6. Portable — written in C, making it easier to port to different hardware

Now there are Linux Distro?
A Linux distro is a complete OS built around the linux kernel, packaged with sofrtware tools and desktop. The kernel is the engine, and the distribution is like the complete car (engine + body + interior + features.). It inclues the kernel, system tools, package manager, desktop enviroment, default applications, config and defaults.

RPM based uses red hat package manager files, for example Red Hat, CentOS, Fedora, Amazon Linux. Debian-based uses .deb files and they include Debian, Ubuntu and Lunux mint.

RPM-based is common in enterprise/red-hat environmets while Debian-based is popular cloud and deplyment.

I also learnt about the common strucutre of CentOs of a linux OS. Everuthing is a file in liinux. Differences between the relative and absolute path.

# WID
I did a lot of file operations on linux. Navigating a directoiry, creating one, using the vim editor, copying and pasting in the vim editor. Learning filetypes. 

Basic Linux syntax of commands, options, and arguments.
